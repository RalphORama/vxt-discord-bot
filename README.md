# LinkFix for Discord

LinkFix for Discord replies to messages containing URLS that don't embed
properly (`x.com`, `twitter.com`, YouTube Shorts) with URLS that do
(`fxtwitter.com`, `youtu.be`).  Works with spoiler tagging (example: ||url.com/here||)

## Self-Hosting

You can easily self-host this bot with Docker using the following steps:

1. Copy `docker-compose.example.yml` to `docker-compose.yml` (you **do not** need to clone the repo).
2. Edit `docker-compose.yml` and change the line reading `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=` to specify your bot's token.
3. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the bot.

**NB:** See [discordjs.guide][2] for instructions on how to install Node.js,
set up a bot, get a token, and add it to a server.


## Contributing

### Set local development

Follow these steps to get the code up and running:

1) Clone the repo :hugs:
2) Run `npm install`
3) Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
4) Edit `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=` in `.env` to provide your bot token
5) Run `npm run build && npm start`. You're good to go!

### Building and running the Docker image

If you want to build and run the Docker image, follow these steps:

1) Follow steps 1-4 from the above list
2) Run `docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag linkfix` to build the image
3) Start the container with `docker run --env-file ./.env --name linkfix linkfix` to start the bot!

**NB:** Starting the bot with `docker run` will take over your terminal and
ctrl+c will **not** be able to kill the process. You will have to open another
terminal and run `docker kill linkfix` to kill the process. Not sure why this
is the case! :grinning:

### Pull Requests

PRs will only be accepted if they:

- Pass all workflow checks:
   - `npm run lint` passes
   - `docker build` succeeds

Please write a detailed description for your PR! Also note commit messages will
be squashed as part of the merge.
